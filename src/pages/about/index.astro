          <p class="animate">
            I’m a builder who cares about speed <em>and</em> correctness. My
            default mode is: write the spec, ship a prototype, tighten the tests,
            then iterate with real metrics (latency, cost, failures, retention).
          </p>

          <p class="animate">
            I move fast, but I don’t ship garbage: clear specs, tight tests,
            review loops, monitoring, and boring reliability.
          </p>

          <p class="animate">
            I like taking an idea from 0 → production, owning the sharp edges
            (security, privacy, scaling), and leaving behind systems people can
            actually build on.
          </p>

          What I'm doing now

        <article class="space-y-4">
          <p class="animate">
            Right now I’m a Technical Lead at OpenDataLabs, focused on
            privacy-first data portability: writing specs, driving alignment, and
            shipping production implementations.
          </p>
          <p class="animate">
            I tend to own the full surface area—TypeScript/Python services,
            Postgres, and the infra edge (GCP + Cloudflare)—so things actually
            ship and stay shipped.

          What I've done in the past
        </h5>
        <article class="space-y-4">
          <p class="animate">
            Previously at Vana I led teams across backend/frontend/data/ML,
            shipped consumer apps to 100k+ users, and built privacy-sensitive
            platform primitives like OAuth-based permissioning.
          </p>
          <p class="animate">
            Earlier, I shipped an AI image generation product that reached 1M+
            users, and I’ve spent years doing the unglamorous work that makes
            systems scale: performance fixes, cost cuts (including ~90% cloud
            spend reduction), and operational hardening.
          </p>
          <p class="animate">
            Before that: ApplyBoard (MLOps pipeline + production APIs),
            AppCentrica (consulting + delivery across cloud/app stacks), and IBM
            (WebSphere install/upgrade flows). University of Toronto alum.

            I've been writing software for over a decade. The tools and
            problems change but I keep coming back to the same question:
            would I be proud to show this to someone?
          </p>

          <p class="animate">
            I keep a running list of project ideas. Some are half-baked, some
            are way too ambitious, and a few have actually shipped. One became
            an Android app with over a million downloads. Another led to a
            patent. I can't stop adding to the list.

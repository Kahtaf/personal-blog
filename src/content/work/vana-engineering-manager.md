- Managed a cross-functional team (backend, frontend, data, ML) building an API for third-party developers to deliver personalized AI experiences.
- Kept privacy and security as hard requirements, including building an OAuth-based permissioning system for sensitive user data.
- Wrote and maintained API docs for internal and external developers so integration didn’t require tribal knowledge.
- Partnered with leadership on product direction and roadmap so the platform work lined up with real user value.

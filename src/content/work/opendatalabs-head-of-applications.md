- Led a full-stack team shipping consumer apps on top of Vana’s protocol in close partnership with product and design.
- Owned the Vana App (app.vana.com) and staking (stake.vana.org), translating Web3 primitives into Web2-friendly UX while keeping privacy/permissions central.
- Scaled the applications layer to 100k+ users, raising the bar on reliability, architecture, and day-to-day execution.
- Put monitoring + feedback loops in place (PostHog/Sentry) so we caught issues early and shipped fixes fast.

- Led the overhaul of Vana’s Data Portability protocol: wrote the spec, drove alignment, and shipped the implementation with a team of engineers.
- Owned delivery across TypeScript/Python services, Postgres, and the infra surface (GCP + Cloudflare) to get the protocol into production reliably.
- Increased PR throughput and time-to-prototype without letting quality slip by pushing clearer specs, tighter tests, and faster review loops.
- Built the “ship it properly” muscle by conducting end-to-end testing and wrote docs that engineers actually use.

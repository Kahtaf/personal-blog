- Shipped Android and iOS apps for both enterprise clients and startups; owned delivery from requirements to release.
- Built mobile apps with Xamarin, integrating with microservices via REST/JWT and paying attention to real-world auth/session security.
- Ran a tight client feedback loop (bi-weekly demos, rapid iteration) that improved outcomes and trust.
- Improved app security in practical ways: session timeouts, secure storage, and safer handling of cached data.
- Helped clients through App Store submissions and launch planning to avoid last-minute release chaos.

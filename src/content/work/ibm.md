Built and maintained an automated test framework for installing and validating WebSphere Application Server across multiple platforms. Added installation and functionality test scenarios, with a focus on the edge cases that usually slip through. Wrote Windows and Unix scripts to automate repetitive team tasks and make test runs more reliable. When automation broke, triaged the failures and either fixed the framework or filed clear repro steps against the product.

Came back as a software engineer working on install, upgrade, and maintenance flows for WebSphere (Network Deployment and Liberty). Spent most of my time in IBM Installation Manager, debugging real-world failures: upgrades that broke, rollbacks, config drift, platform differences. Cut install time by trimming unnecessary steps in the install path. Wrote build and release automation in Java, Ant, Maven, and some JavaScript tooling to make releases less manual.

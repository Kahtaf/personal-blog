- Delivered production-grade Python APIs around ML models, with clean contracts for data science teams and downstream consumers.
- Shipped workflow-acceleration features (document search/verification, passport OCR, plagiarism checks) that reduced manual effort for users.
- Tackled performance issues directly (including N+1/query problems) and improved API responsiveness under load.
- Worked across Python/Ruby/TypeScript/React plus Docker/Kubernetes depending on what the problem needed.
- Conducted system design interviews and contributed to the hiring process.

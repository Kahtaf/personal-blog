Led a full-stack team shipping consumer apps on top of Vana's protocol. I focused on translating Web3 primitives into UX that felt normal to Web2 users, without compromising on privacy or permissions. Owned the Vana App and staking products, scaled the applications layer to 100k+ users, and set up PostHog and Sentry so we caught issues before users did.

Later took over as technical lead and ran the overhaul of Vana's Data Portability protocol: wrote the spec, got the team on the same page, and shipped the implementation. Owned delivery across TypeScript and Python services, Postgres, and the infra surface (GCP + Cloudflare). Sped up PR throughput and time-to-prototype by pushing clearer specs and tighter review loops. Wrote the kind of end-to-end tests and docs that engineers actually use.

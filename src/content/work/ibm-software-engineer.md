- Worked on install, upgrade, and maintenance flows for IBM WebSphere Application Server across both Network Deployment (ND) and Liberty.
- Built and debugged packages using IBM Installation Manager, focusing on real-world failures: upgrades, rollbacks, config/state drift, and platform differences.
- Cut install time by reducing unnecessary work in the install path and tightening up packaging/validation steps.
- Triaged and fixed installer crashes and hard-failure edge cases, driving issues from repro to root cause to a shipped fix.
- Wrote and maintained automation around build/release tasks (Java + Ant/Maven, plus JavaScript tooling) to make releases more repeatable and reduce manual steps.

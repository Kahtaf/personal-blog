Joined as an early engineering hire. Designed a patented method for encrypting large datasets using a Web3 wallet (non-custodial encryption and decryption), then built the data wallet and secure APIs around it. Also built a framework for offline, in-browser data processing so we didn't have to route everything through centralized services. Audited cloud spend and cut the AWS bill by roughly 90%.

As technical lead, took an AI image generation app from idea to launch in two weeks, then kept it running as usage grew past 1M users. Rebuilt model-wrapping APIs as models improved, cutting waste in storage and compute. Wrote design docs that let frontend and backend work in parallel instead of handing off sequentially. Ran technical interviews and helped grow the engineering team.

Moved into engineering management, leading a team across backend, frontend, data, and ML. We built an API for third-party developers to deliver personalized AI experiences, with privacy and security as hard requirements. That included an OAuth-based permissioning system for sensitive user data. Wrote and maintained API docs so integration didn't require tribal knowledge. Worked with leadership to keep platform work pointed at actual user problems.

- Took an AI image generation app from idea to launch in 2 weeks, then scaled it as usage grew to 1M+ users over the following months.
- Rebuilt model-wrapping APIs as models improved, cutting waste (time/storage/cost) and reducing operational pain.
- Drove design docs that made parallel work possible across frontend + backend, instead of serial “handoff” development.
- Ran technical interviews and helped grow the engineering team with a higher signal, more consistent process.

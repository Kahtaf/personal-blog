Started out building internal and consumer-facing systems for a major automaker using Spring (Boot, MVC, Data, Security), MS SQL, and AWS. Shipped Spring microservices in Docker with CI/CD in Azure DevOps. Pushed test coverage and code review standards up, which cut regressions and made releases less painful. Mentored newer engineers and helped establish reusable patterns across projects.

Moved into mobile, shipping Android and iOS apps for enterprise clients and startups with Xamarin, REST, and JWT. Ran bi-weekly demos with clients and iterated fast, which built trust and led to bigger engagements. Tightened up app security (session timeouts, secure storage, safer caching) and guided clients through App Store submissions so launches went smoothly.

Eventually took on a management role. Led multiple client deliveries while still writing code in Spring Boot, Angular, Node, Salesforce, and Mulesoft when needed. Set up CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps and Terraform-based infrastructure-as-code so environments were reproducible. Worked with AWS architects on system reviews, and led the effort to get AppCentrica its AWS partner designations. Ran hiring, onboarding, 1:1s, and performance reviews.

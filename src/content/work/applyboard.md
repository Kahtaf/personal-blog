Built an MLOps pipeline from scratch (Terraform, GitHub Actions, SageMaker, Python) so ML models could ship like real software. Wrote production Python APIs around those models with clean contracts for data science teams and downstream consumers. Shipped features that cut manual work for users: document verification, passport OCR, plagiarism checks.

Fixed performance problems (N+1 queries, slow endpoints under load) and worked across Python, Ruby, TypeScript, React, Docker, and Kubernetes depending on what the problem needed. Also ran system design interviews.
